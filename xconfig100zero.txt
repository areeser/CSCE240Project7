Format documentation:

The first line has seven numeric fields, all of which are whitespace-delimited.
Field 1: Integer.  Sets the random-number generator's seed.  Keep this consistent
         for consistent output.
Field 2: Positive integer.  Sets the number of hours in election day.
Field 3: Positive integer.  Average (mean) time-to-vote for an individual voter.  Used to
         estimate the number of stations.
Field 4: Positive integer.  Minimum number of voters allowed per precinct.
Field 5: Positive integer.  Maximum number of voters allowed per precinct.
Field 6: Positive integer.  Maximum acceptable waiting time.
Field 7: Nonnegative integer.  Number of simulations to run.

The second line contains 1 + N real-number fields where N is the number of hours
in election day.  The very first field on the second line indicates the
percentage of voters who are present when the polls open.  The next N fields
represent the percentage of voters who arrive at hour N of the election day.

All of the fields on line 2 should sum to 100%.

Given below is an example configuration.
