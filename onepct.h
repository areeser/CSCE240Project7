/****************************************************************
 * Header for the 'OnePct' class
 *
 * Author/copyright:  Duncan Buell
 * Modified by: Group 6
 * Date: 28 November 2016
 *
 * This is a header file for one voter precinct in a simulation.
 * An instance of a precinct contains member variables to detail
 * general precinct information and expected voter turnouts.
 * A precinct also contains four private multi-maps that track
 * voters in line, voters currently voting, voters who have
 * voted, and other data structures related to the numbers of
 * available and total voting stations.
 *
 * General functions include a ToStringVoterMap() to format
 * output for various multi-maps. The ReadData() function
 * reads data for the setup of a precinct and relating to the
 * accompanying simulation. ReadSimulation() allows this
 * precinct to be included in a simulation based on the seed
 * that has been randomly generated by MyRandom.
 *
 * Other member variables are used in computing this precinct's
 * average wait time for each voter and the standard deviation
 * of waiting times. Also contains dummy constant variables.
 *
 * A 'precinct' also contains private functions to computer the
 * mean and standard deviation, create voters within the precinct,
 * and compute the other statistics, stored in member variables.
