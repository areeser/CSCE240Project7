/* -- What does it do?
 * Allows this program to compile and run in order to help us understand it.
 * Calls to Output() will either
 *    -- fail to compile with an inscrutable error message, or
 *    -- print a string to both output and log streams, along with a tag
 *       identifying why the output showed up.
 *
 * -- What is the signature:  void(string, output stream, log stream).
 *
 * -- How do you use this?
 * Add the text, verbatim:
      -include compile-me-hack.include.h
 * at the end of the very first line of 'makefile', such that it looks like
      GPP = g++ -O3 -Wall -std=c++11 -include compile-me-hack.include.h
